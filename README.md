# Context Admission Control (CAC)

> **RAG retrieves chunks. CAC satisfies evidence requirements.**

Context Admission Control (CAC) is a research prototype for **evidence admission under budget**. It is designed for evidence-sensitive AI workflows where the model should not simply read the most relevant chunks — it should reason from the **right evidence**, in the **right representation**, with an **audit trail**.

CAC changes the unit of context from:

```text
retrieved chunk
```

to:

```text
satisfied evidence requirement
```

This repository includes:

- the CAC packet-building prototype,
- DecisionRiskBench v1.4,
- RAG-style baselines,
- packaged benchmark outputs,
- rewrite and stress suites,
- no-gold-admission tests,
- and an external LLM prompt/export harness for future answer evaluation.

---

## Why CAC?

Classic RAG usually follows this pattern:

```text
query → retrieve chunks → stuff context → answer
```

That works for many lookup tasks. But evidence-sensitive decisions often require more than chunk relevance:

- Which source is authoritative?
- Is the evidence current?
- Is exact wording required?
- What evidence is missing?
- Which sources contradict each other?
- What should be excluded as stale, low-authority, or distracting?
- How much model context should this evidence cost?

CAC adds a context-control layer:

```text
task → evidence requirements → candidate pool → evidence valuation
     → representation selection → evidence packet → answer
```

The core claim:

> **RAG optimizes chunk relevance. CAC optimizes evidence sufficiency under budget.**

## How CAC differs from RAG

| RAG | CAC |
|---|---|
| Retrieves chunks | Satisfies evidence requirements |
| Optimizes relevance | Optimizes sufficiency under budget |
| Stuffs raw text | Chooses representations |
| Usually cites retrieved docs | Audits admission/exclusion decisions |
| Often answers from what it found | Reports missing evidence |
| More context can mean more noise | Context is governed by evidence policy |

![Distractor rate vs budget](outputs/decision_risk_v1_4_n20/distractor_rate_vs_budget.svg)

## Who this is for

CAC is for builders working on:
- enterprise AI assistants
- auditable QA
- decision support
- compliance / security / contract workflows
- post-RAG context engineering
- LLM evaluation and retrieval benchmarks

CAC is probably overkill for:
- simple FAQ bots
- single-document lookup
- low-stakes retrieval demos

## What CAC Builds

CAC outputs an **evidence packet**, not a bag of chunks.

An evidence packet can contain:

```text
structured facts
summaries
exact excerpts
conflicts
uncertainties
excluded evidence
audit trace
filled evidence requirements
missing evidence requirements
```

Example:

```json
{
  "structured_facts": [
    {
      "source": "billing_row_044",
      "fact": {
        "invoice_status": "47_days_overdue",
        "outstanding_balance": 184000
      }
    }
  ],
  "exact_evidence": [
    {
      "source": "contract_184_section_12_2",
      "text": "Non-payment of undisputed fees for more than forty-five days constitutes material breach after notice."
    }
  ],
  "conflicts": [
    {
      "issue": "CRM says the account is healthy; billing and support indicate risk."
    }
  ],
  "uncertainties": [
    "No executive sponsor signal found."
  ],
  "excluded_evidence": [
    {
      "source": "slack_thread_332",
      "reason": "Low-authority speculation without attached source."
    }
  ]
}
```

Design rule:

> **Compress facts. Preserve language when wording carries obligation, ambiguity, or risk.**

---

## Project Status

This is a **research prototype and synthetic benchmark artifact**.

It is suitable for:

- studying post-RAG context-control architectures,
- comparing evidence packets against chunk-stuffing baselines,
- experimenting with auditable evidence admission,
- and reproducing DecisionRiskBench v1.4 results.

It is **not** production proof.

### Supported by this repository

On synthetic DecisionRiskBench v1.4, CAC achieves stronger aggregate decision-grade and deterministic answer-readiness proxy outcomes than the included chunk-stuffing RAG baselines under same-candidate-pool conditions.

**RAG is in trouble for evidence-sensitive decision work because chunk relevance is losing to evidence sufficiency under budget.**

## Headline Reference Result

Packaged main run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m benchmarks.decision_risk.run \
  --n 20 \
  --budgets 40,60,80,120,160,240,500 \
  --distractors 5,25,50 \
  --output-dir outputs/decision_risk_v1_4_n20
```

Shape:

```text
20 accounts × 4 tasks × 7 budgets × 3 distractor levels × 8 methods = 13,440 rows
```

Aggregate results from the packaged output:

| Method | Avg Tokens | Decision Grade | Answer-Readiness Proxy | Distractor Rate | Exact Clause | Contradiction Recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `cac` | 60.1583 | **0.8101** | **0.8556** | **0.0464** | **0.9750** | **0.6280** |
| `schema_aware_chunk_rag_k8` | 85.2643 | 0.6892 | 0.7366 | 0.2923 | 0.8923 | 0.2101 |
| `iterative_rag_k8` | 69.6815 | 0.6876 | 0.7374 | 0.2344 | 0.8083 | 0.2458 |
| `oracle_candidate_rag_k8` | 87.2554 | 0.6794 | 0.7455 | 0.2750 | 0.9524 | 0.1815 |
| `metadata_aware_rag_k8` | 85.1798 | 0.6717 | 0.7106 | 0.2923 | 0.8869 | 0.2101 |
| `heuristic_rerank_rag_k8` | 87.8994 | 0.6403 | 0.6892 | 0.3393 | 0.8652 | 0.1649 |
| `long_context_rag_k24` | 126.6375 | 0.6046 | 0.6270 | 0.5209 | 0.7438 | 0.2458 |
| `fixed_context_rag_k8` | 86.4607 | 0.5934 | 0.6310 | 0.4445 | 0.6997 | 0.2458 |

CAC also wins every included task family by decision-grade score in the packaged main run:

```text
contract termination
incident postmortem
renewal risk
security exception
```

## Benchmark Boundary

DecisionRiskBench v1.4 tests **context-control strategy**, not retriever quality.

All compared methods use the same candidate pool. The difference is how they assemble context:

- RAG baselines admit raw chunks.
- CAC can admit compact evidence representations such as structured facts, summaries, and exact excerpts.

That distinction is intentional. CAC is being evaluated as **evidence admission**, not as another retriever.

This is also a methodological boundary. Stronger future baselines should include compression-aware and answer-aware RAG variants.

---

## Deterministic Answer-Readiness Proxy

The generated-answer metric in this repository is a **deterministic answer-readiness proxy**.

It is not an LLM answer study and it is not a human preference study.

The next empirical milestone is:

```text
RAG chunks → same LLM → answer
CAC evidence packet → same LLM → answer
human or LLM judge → score
```

This repository includes prompt export and answer-scoring scaffolding for that next step, but it does not include real model outputs.

When using the external LLM prompt export, send only the `prompt` field to the model. Do not send gold metadata fields used later for scoring.

---

## No-Gold-Admission Boundary

`SourceItem` carries benchmark gold fields for scoring and for the explicit oracle baseline. Tests assert that CAC core and non-oracle RAG baselines do **not** read these scorer-only fields:

```text
gold_slots
gold_negative
gold_positive
gold_exact_required
is_distractor
```

The explicit `oracle_candidate_rag_k8` baseline is allowed to use these fields by design.

## Reproduce the Main Suites

### Main DecisionRiskBench suite

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m benchmarks.decision_risk.run \
  --n 20 \
  --budgets 40,60,80,120,160,240,500 \
  --distractors 5,25,50 \
  --output-dir outputs/decision_risk_v1_4_n20
```

### Semi-synthetic rewrite suite

The rewrite suite perturbs source wording and observable metadata to reduce reliance on templated phrase matching.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m benchmarks.decision_risk_human_rewrite.run \
  --n 8 \
  --budgets 40,60,80,120,160,240 \
  --distractors 25,50 \
  --metadata-noise 0.18 \
  --output-dir outputs/decision_risk_v1_4_rewrite
```

### Failure-stress suite

The stress suite targets contradiction misses, slot underfill, exact-representation failure, and high distractor pressure.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m benchmarks.decision_risk_stress.run \
  --n 8 \
  --budgets 40,60,80,120,160 \
  --distractors 50,100 \
  --metadata-noise 0.30 \
  --output-dir outputs/decision_risk_v1_4_stress
```

### External LLM prompt export

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m benchmarks.decision_risk.export_llm_eval_prompts \
  --n 5 \
  --budget 160 \
  --distractors 25 \
  --output outputs/llm_eval_v1_4/prompts.jsonl
```

After filling a JSONL file with model answers:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m benchmarks.decision_risk.llm_eval \
  --answers outputs/llm_eval_v1_4/model_answers.jsonl \
  --output-dir outputs/llm_eval_v1_4_eval
```

## Key Concepts

### Evidence requirement

A task-specific requirement that must be satisfied for a decision to be well supported.

Examples:

```text
current billing status
contract termination language
security exception approval
incident root cause
missing executive sponsor signal
```

### Evidence packet

The final CAC context artifact. It can contain structured facts, exact excerpts, summaries, conflicts, uncertainties, exclusions, and an audit trace.

### Representation-aware admission

CAC chooses whether evidence should be represented as a structured fact, summary, exact excerpt, metadata, or excluded entirely.

### Missing-evidence calibration

CAC can explicitly state that a required evidence slot was not found or not sufficiently satisfied.

### Same-candidate-pool evaluation

All compared methods receive the same candidate evidence pool. The benchmark tests context assembly, not retriever quality.

---

## Baselines

Included baselines:

```text
fixed_context_rag_k8
metadata_aware_rag_k8
schema_aware_chunk_rag_k8
heuristic_rerank_rag_k8
iterative_rag_k8
long_context_rag_k24
oracle_candidate_rag_k8
```

The oracle baseline is intentionally synthetic and uses gold labels for candidate ordering. It is included to test whether better candidate ordering alone closes the gap.

---

## Limitations

This repository is intentionally transparent about what it does not prove.

Current limitations:

```text
Synthetic benchmark.
Semi-synthetic rewrite suite is not human-audited real data.
Generated-answer metric is deterministic, not real LLM/human evaluation.
No production deployment results.
No human preference study.
No real enterprise dataset.
```

The strongest current conclusion is:

> CAC is a promising post-RAG control-plane candidate for evidence-sensitive decisions.

Not:

> CAC is production-proven.

---

## Roadmap

Planned next steps:

```text
same-model LLM answer evaluation
human or LLM-judge scoring
human-audited mini-set
real or semi-real dataset
compression-aware RAG baselines
answer-aware RAG baselines
more task profiles
```

The next decisive test:

```text
Do the same LLMs make better decisions from CAC packets than from RAG chunks?
```
